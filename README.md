- 👋 Hi, I’m Ceren
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, maths, table tennis and theatre.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Machine Learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which are mainly about website development with Flask/Node-React, web scraping, GUI creation, creating RESTful APIs and using them. In addition to that, data exploration and visualisation projects will challenge me in a good way :) 
- 📫 You can reach me via email: ceren.sahin04@gmail.com I am an enthusiastic learner so any project idea to collaborate on would make me a better programmer.
- 💻 As you might have guessed, I am mainly building projects using Python, besides that the other languages I know are Javascript, HTML/CSS, Node.js, React.js.
