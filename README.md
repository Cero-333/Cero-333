- 👋 Hi, I’m Ceren
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, maths, drawing and theatre.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Development and will start a course about Artificial Intelligence with Python soon. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which are mainly built by using one of these packages: Turtle, Tkinter, Selenium, Flask, SQLAlchemy. In addition to that, data exploration and visualisation projects will challenge me in a good way :) 
- 📫 You can reach me via email: ceren.sahin04@gmail.com I am an enthusiastic learner so any project idea to collaborate on would make me a better programmer.
- 💻 As you might have guessed, I am mainly building projects using Python, besides that the other programming/mark-up languages I know are Dart, HTML, CSS.
